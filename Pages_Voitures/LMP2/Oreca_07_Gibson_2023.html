                    The LMP2 category has seen ultra-competitive racing for
                    several
                    years and the 2023 season was no exception, with five
                    different
                    teams taking victories in the final year for the class. The
                    #22
                    and #23 United Autosports cars claimed the opening two
                    rounds,
                    before the #41 Team WRT car took the honours in the third
                    leg of
                    the season. Inter Europol Competition took an unexpected and
                    incredible win at Le Mans before JOTA had success at Monza.
                    The
                    eventual champions, the #41 Team WRT car driven by Robert
                    Kubica, Rui Andrade and Louis Delétraz, got into their
                    stride in
                    Asia by winning in Fuji before Middle Eastern delight in
                    Bahrain
                    saw them win both the championship closer and the title.<br>

                    Many of the drivers and teams have used the LMP2 category as
                    a
                    prototype education – learning the fundamentals of the FIA
                    WEC.
                    The car features a powerful 4.2-litre V8 from Gibson
                    Technology
                    and all are shod with the same Goodyear tyres. Coupled with
                    the
                    lightweight chassis, the ORECA can produce some giant
                    killing
                    performances, hunting down some of the slower Hypercars in
                    the
                    process.
