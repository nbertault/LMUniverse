                    What can be said about Toyota that hasn’t been said before.
                    A
                    staple of the endurance racing scene since the turn of the
                    Millenium, their roll of honour is enviable. The Japanese
                    firm
                    has been supremely loyal to the FIA World Endurance, despite
                    the
                    withdrawal of Audi and Porsche by the end of 2017. With the
                    introduction of the Hypercar category in 2021, Toyota –
                    while
                    fully embracing the competition – went from the hunter to
                    the
                    hunted.<br>

                    Sealing victories and titles were expected from the Japanese
                    automotive giant in the opening two seasons of the category,
                    but
                    the target was well and truly on its back for the
                    highly-anticipated 2023 season.<br>

                    With the strongest driver line-ups on the grid, the #7 and
                    #8
                    cars dominated for most of the year, sweeping to six
                    victories
                    from the seven rounds and sealing first and second in the
                    FIA
                    WEC championship standings in efficient style. The only blot
                    in
                    the copybook was ceding the Le Mans victory to Ferrari.
                    Expect
                    revenge in 2024 from the Toyota team.<br>
