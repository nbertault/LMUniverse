                    Cadillac joined the fray in 2023 with its distinctive
                    V-Series.R
                    – a car you can hear coming with its thunderous 5.5-litre
                    V8.<br>

                    Cadillac have developed the car using the Dallara chassis
                    and
                    opted for a single-car approach for the full season in the
                    FIA
                    WEC with the #2 car spearheading its assault. The number two
                    and
                    dark blue were used to pay homage to Cadillac’s first foray
                    into
                    the 24 Hours of Le Mans – the 1950 Briggs Cunningham –
                    nicknamed
                    ‘Le Monstre’.<br>

                    The #2 had a solid first season in the FIA WEC against some
                    of
                    the more established names. Three top five results were a
                    strong
                    start in the opening half of the season – but the turning
                    point
                    came at Le Mans with the team securing the final podium
                    place
                    after a tough 24 hours.<br>

                    A further two Cadillacs came from America to back up the #2
                    for
                    selected rounds of the championship, including the 24 Hours
                    of
                    Le Mans where the #3 car finished an impressive fourth
                    overall.
