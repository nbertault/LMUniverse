                    The A424 Hybrid Hypercar, from the French sports car
                    manufacturer Alpine – conjures up the magic and mystique of
                    sports car racing from yesteryear. It’s angular, purposeful
                    looks, complete with vibrant Mecachrome 3.4-litre V6 engine
                    note
                    makes the A424 stand out on the FIA WEC grid.<br>

                    Alpine have a long and successful road through the history
                    books
                    of sports car racing. From its first participation in the 24
                    Hours of Le Mans in the early sixties – the Alpine name has
                    written several chapters of success. Aligning with parent
                    company Renault – the Alpine brand took on the gruelling
                    challenge of Le Mans, head on in the late seventies, with
                    the
                    top step of the podium in 1979 the fruitful reward.<br>

                    Following a whole host of class successes at Le Mans, ‘le
                    bleu’
                    returned to the top-flight in 2021 and scored a podium with
                    its
                    A480 in the first year for the Hypercar category and months
                    later, Alpine made the announcement of a return to the top
                    table
                    in 2024. 2023 was used to keep the team and drivers match
                    fit
                    while competing in the ultra-competitive LMP2 category. A
                    car
                    you can drive in Le Mans Ultimate.<br>

                    With the competition advancing at a rapid pace, a new car
                    was
                    penned on the drawing board – maximising the potential of a
                    car
                    build from scratch to the class regulations. The car… the
                    A424.<br>

                    The team unveiled the car ahead of the centenary edition of
                    the
                    24 Hours of Le Mans and boasted a formidable line-up of
                    drivers,
                    with Pau-Loup Chatin, Ferdinand Habsburg and Charles Milesi
                    piloting the #35 car while, Nicolas Lapierre, Matthieu
                    Vaxivere
                    and Mick Schumacher take charge of the #36 A424.<br>

                    Making its debut in the desert of Qatar in 2024, the blue
                    rocket
                    finished in seventh overall a stunning debut for the new car
                    –
                    and best of the 2024 machines. A further top ten followed at
                    Spa, before a troubled race on home soil at Le Mans made the
                    French outfit regroup for the second half of the season. A
                    first
                    top ten for the #36 in Brazil was backed up in COTA with the
                    best result to date with fifth for the #35 and ninth for the
                    #36. Japan was calling in September and the best pair of
                    results
                    for a new 2024 car in the season so far came in Fuji with a
                    stunning third overall for the #36 and seventh for the #35.
