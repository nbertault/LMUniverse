                The evolution era has begun in the FIA World Endurance
                Championship, with Peugeot parking its ground effect, wingless
                wonder for a new-look purposeful 9X8 for 2024 with 90% of the
                bodywork completely redefined.<br>

                In 2024 Peugeot Sport started its campaign with the 2023 car and
                challenged for the win in Qatar. The #93 car was on course for
                second place – a dream result to start the season – but power
                failure saw them not finish the race.<br>

                When the series retuned to Europe, the French team pulled the
                covers off its 2024 9X8 – with the much talked about rear wing
                making its first appearance. The #93 car managed a solid top
                result on its debut with two more top ten results following for
                the #93 with ninth at Spa and eighth in Brazil – the best result
                for the car to date. at the Italian circuit.<br>

                Luck hasn’t blessed the #94 car with the team struggling to
                match the pace of the sister car with a best result of 11th at
                Le Mans the highlight so far. The team are looking horns with
                some of the worlds biggest automotive car makers and sit sixth
                in the constructors championship.<br>

                Peugeot are performing live testing at every venue this year,
                gathering data and knowledge – and sees 2024 as a development
                year for the car with eyes fully on making an impact in 2025.
