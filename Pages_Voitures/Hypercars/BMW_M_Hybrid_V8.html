                    BMW are previous winners of Le Mans, with the German brand
                    sealing outright victory in 1999. Fast forward 25 years and
                    BMW
                    returns and enters two BMW M Hybrids in the 2024 FIA WEC
                    season.<br>

                    Using a Dallara chassis, the LMDh machine was competitive
                    from
                    the outset, battling with the established names in the
                    highly-competitive Hypercar class.<br>

                    Imola is the best result to date in 2024 – with a solid
                    sixth
                    overall for the #20 machine. #20 was to be a special number
                    for
                    BMW in 2024 as it marked the 20th Art Car produced by the
                    Bavarian outfit, with Julie Mehretu penning the 20th version
                    for
                    the team at Le Mans.<br>

                    The BMW M Hybrid was the first 2024 car to be added to the
                    Le
                    Mans Ultimate line-up ahead of the 24 Hours of Le Mans.
