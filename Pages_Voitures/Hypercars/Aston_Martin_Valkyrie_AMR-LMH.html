                    The Aston Martin Valkyrie AMR- LMH marks the British
                    marque’s return to top-class endurance racing in the FIA
                    World Endurance Championship (WEC). Based on the radical
                    road-going Valkyrie hypercar, the LMH version is developed
                    in collaboration with Heart of Racing and engineered by
                    Aston Martin Performance Technologies.<br>

                    The project revives Aston Martin’s ambitions after its
                    previous Valkyrie-based Hypercar program was paused in 2020.
                    Re-entering competition in 2025, the Valkyrie AMR-LMH
                    features a naturally aspirated V12 engine, adapted for
                    endurance racing, and competes against other factory-backed
                    entries in the Hypercar class.<br>

                    While both cars have successfully completed every race since
                    Qatar, the pace and competitiveness is still to be found
                    with P12 in the 2025 24 Hours Le Mans the highest finishing
                    position so far. The Valkyrie LMH aims to reestablish Aston
                    Martin as a top contender on the world stage of endurance
                    racing.
