                    First homologated in 2022, the BMW M4 GT3 is the latest from
                    a
                    lineage of BMW GT cars including the Z4 GT3, M6 GT3 and M8
                    GTE.
                    Returning to Le Mans and the World Endurance Championship in
                    GT
                    after a 5 year absence, the brand partnered with sportscar
                    ace
                    team WRT, and gave a set of keys to 9 x Motorcycle World
                    Champion Valentino Rossi.<br>

                    The BMW M4 GT3 had already proven its pace in competition in
                    other GT series before FIA WEC, but with a 1 – 2 finish in
                    Imola
                    and a strong showing in Le Mans the team came away with 4th
                    overall in the classification.
